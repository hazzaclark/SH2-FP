# SH2-FP

Hitachi SuperH (SH4) FPU Emulator with innate support for SH2 FP arithmetic

# Motive:

The ambiition behind this project moreover is to provide a means by which FP-related logic is able to repurposed and moulded to suit the innate design of a particular architecture. 
In this case, I want to be able to leverage the SH4's FPU to be able to handle the SH2's FP as well.

This came about as a result of two major developments:

A. I wanted to work on a research piece indicative of something worthwhile

B. This notion of it being worthwhile could fall into the hands of someone willing to expand upon my original idea (SEGA Saturn games ported to the SEGA Dreamcast)
